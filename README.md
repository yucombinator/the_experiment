# the_experiment
A repository where anyone can contribute, and anything goes. Will this repo become a cool app? A terrible website? A dank meme? YOU get to decide the fate of this repository!

<b>Edit from the owner: yo srsly let's do something more useful</b>

Unlike an [earlier](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything) similar experiment, let's actually try to ship something... usable! I don't want to give too many instructions, but I've laid down a sort of roadmap for this experiment below... Not that you have to follow it.

- Set up some sort of web framework
- Ship code
- Release
- Profit???

## Get a butt lamp today!

<br>Why? because we appreciate .

## Why?
I'm interested in how random people can work on something together spontaneously.

Let's see how this one works out... Feel free to use Issues, or the Wiki to communicate. Plus I want to help people get a free shirt.

##Ooooh! How do I help?

Don't be this guy.

You can help with the experiment by making a pull request with anything you want to do. <b>Nothing illegal or that might get me arrested please.</b> I'll just accept as many PRs as I can. If you behave yourself (or just ask) then I can add you as an contributor!
