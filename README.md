# the_experiment
A repository where anyone can contribute, and anything goes. Will this repo become a cool app? A terrible website? A dank meme? YOU get to decide the fate of this repository!

Unlike an [earlier](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything) similar experiment, let's actually try to ship something... usable! I don't want to give too many instructions, but I've laid down a sort of roadmap for this experiment below... Not that you have to follow it.

- [ ] Set up some sort of web framework
- [ ] Ship code
- [ ] Release
- [ ] Profit???

## Get a butt lamp today!

Why? Don't ask.

## Why?
I'm interested in how random people can work on something together spontaneously. Let's see how this one works out... Feel free to use Issues, or the Wiki to communicate. Plus I want to help people get a free shirt.

##Ooooh! How do I help?
You can help with the experiment by making a pull request with anything you want to do. <b>Nothing illegal or that might get me arrested please.</b> I'll just accept as many PRs as I can. If you behave yourself (or just ask) then I can add you as an contributor!
